# What the Hell is Going On With The U.S. Military?
*This is an excerpt from [The Most Powerful but Inept Military Surrendered to The Parasitic Cabal](https://lostvoice.substack.com/p/the-most-powerful-but-inept-military).*

Why are they acting so different from the two other rival armies (Chinese and Russian)?

All we can say about the U.S. Military is that they should have read The [*Art of War* by Sun Tzu](https://suntzusaid.com/), 
one of the most important and oldest military books because by their acts, it does look like 
they didn’t bother to even read the first two chapters.

Surely the Chinese military already applied the book’s timeless military strategies and 
tactics since its armed forces are very disciplined, are shrouded in mystery especially 
because of their cultural and language barriers, show a lot of unity (their patriotic 
soldiers believe strongly in their country), are not used willy-nilly around the world <sup>1</sup> 
and so on.

Also, the Chinese military along with other armed forces around the world (e.g. Russian) 
have not incorporated wokeness within their militaries since talking about social justice 
seems to paradoxically bring more disunity within your ranks. These militaries might fear 
that if they introduce wokeness, every service member will be more focused in their own 
personal struggle instead of seeing himself/herself as a cog<sup>2</sup> among others that together
will defend the nation. You can’t have strong global unity if each unit is arguing against 
each other about who is the most oppressed among them<sup>3</sup>.

The Chinese and Russians must be thinking: ["Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."](https://twitter.com/usarmy/status/242294060650475521)

Here are more ancient Chinese wisdom that would have helped the U.S. Armed Forces 
throughout their most recent military campaigns:

- "There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare."

  [Sun Tzu](https://suntzusaid.com/book/2/6)

- "Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources;"

  [Sun Tzu](https://suntzusaid.com/book/9/36)

- "If bees and scorpions carry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent, then, should not be treated with contempt."

## Notes

1. Hence, the Chinese government is left with lots of money to invest 
   in their infrastructure (e.g. high-speed rail and bridges) to keep 
   the populace happy. And the Belt and Road Initiative might be so 
   economically viable that maybe one day they will surpass the US in 
   military spending.
   
2. From the Wikipedia article on [military training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military#Training): “Individuality is 
   suppressed (e.g. by shaving the head of new recruits, issuing uniforms, 
   denying privacy, and prohibiting the use of first names)”
   
   Or in the words of Tyler Durden: “You are not special. You are not a 
   beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter 
   as everything else.”

3. [Chang Yu](https://suntzusaid.com/book/7/24) says: “If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the 
   same object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be 
   like those of a single man.”
