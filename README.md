# Two questions about the U.S. Military “vaccinating” their service members against COVID-19:

1. Why would you “vaccinate” your service members without first checking what is really in the vials? 

    You have Military doctors and scientists that at least know how to use a   light microscope and they probably have access to electron microscopes.

    No military should ever completely rely on what pharmaceutical companies (or any company whatsoever<sup>1</sup>) say about their products even if said company is local because you might have hostile employees working in them. 

    Just like the U.S. government [mistrust](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/u-s-to-limit-use-of-chinese-power-equipment-on-military-bases) some electrical products coming from China and with reason (China too should be suspicious of anything American), they should treat with the same extreme caution any health products that will be applied to their service members. If they have done their diligent work, they would have found [graphene oxide and other unknown materials in the vials](https://www.orwell.city/2021/10/human-DNA-alteration.html). 

2. Why not “vaccinate” first a small group and see what kind of side effects they have? 

    In other words, do your own in-house analysis of the “vaccinated” instead of “vaccinating” everyone like the world is ending soon. In particular, you could have checked the blood of the “vaccinated” and you may have seen [red blood cells with abnormal shapes](https://uncutnews.ch/purer-horror-arzt-entdeckt-mysterioese-schwarze-strukturen-im-blut-von-geimpften-patienten/).

----------------------------------------------------

By “vaccinating” every service members with an experimental product which we don’t have yet any long-term studies of its side effects (and the short-term research doesn’t paint a pretty picture so far), you now run the risk of killing and injuring a huge percentage of your personnel.

Consequently, the U.S. Military might be in the near future in a situation where it won’t be able to adequately defend the nation against external and internal foes and the USA is not lacking in the enemy department. Many hate U.S.’s guts (from China to part of [USA’s own population](https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-taliban-afghanistan-social-media-facebook-twitter/), and especially the Middle East) and are cheering for their eventual collapse so a new World Order can be established.

## Notes
1. For instance, you might not know that a backdoor may have been 
   installed in the software that you use, especially if it is 
   closed-source. Thus you won’t expect the U.S. Military to accept 
   blindly installing any software in their IT systems without doing 
   their own deep investigation to make sure the program is safe.
